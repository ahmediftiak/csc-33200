Q2. (50 Points) (Threads)
Consider the following code. What is the MAXIMUM value printed? Give a Scenario  for this value.
NOTE: the scenario is critical. If the scenario is grossly wrong, then your answer is essentially a guess and you lose a lot of points. 

cobegin-coend are as discussed in slides. 
Assume that all the variables before cobegin are in heap; so they are shared with the children threads.
As in slides, after coend is done (i.e., children thread have finished), the parent thread resumes execution.

				int counter=0;		//in heap.
				cobegin
for (int i=0; i<1000; i++)			for (int i=0; i<1000; i++)
	counter++;					counter = counter - 1; //WATCH OUT!!
				coend
				print(counter);


Answer:
MAX = 1000

Scenario:
		Thread 1				Thread 2
As part of counter++, Load value of
counter into R1
Then, i == counter == R1 == 0			
							Finish the Iterations and then exit.
stores R1 into counter.
Increment i
then counter = i == 1
we do this (counter++; ยก++) 999 times.
Thus, counter == ยก == 1000
Exit

Parent thread prints 1000

Explanation:
Thread 1 starts first and then Thread 2 starts, finish the iterations and finish. After that, Thread 1 overwrites the Thread 2 values which gives the max value of 1000.
