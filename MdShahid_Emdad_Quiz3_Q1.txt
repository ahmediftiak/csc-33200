Q1. (50 Points) (Memory)
Consider the memory management scheme using paging.
Let T be the page frame number column in the page table. Assume that the page table for process 2 satisfies T[i]=2i+3 for all pages i.
Assume that the page size is 64 bytes.
Convert the PHYSICAL  ADDRESS 2000  in process 2 to the corresponding logical  address. All numbers here and in your answer are in decimal. Show detailed calculations.


Solution:
Page frame number = 2000/64 = 31
Offset = 2000 - 31*64 = 16
2i+3 = 31, so i = 14
page number = 14
Logical address = 14*64 + 16 = 896+16 = 912
