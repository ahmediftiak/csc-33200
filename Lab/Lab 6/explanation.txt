For Task 6, I had issues with the buffer incrementing without being incremented and printing twice for the agent
(I made sure to confirm that only one of the processes was acting as the agent).
Because I was unable to eliminate the problems, I chose to complete the base version in order to submit a usable document.
I'll add the extra credit version because it's halfway finished and would function if it weren't for the bugs.

In both versions, I use three fork() calls to create a total of four processes. I did so by having the process which saw
the pid output of the previous fork as greater than zero perform another fork. I also defined TOBACCO as 0, PAPER as 1,
and MATCH as 2. This convention is used throughout the code.
